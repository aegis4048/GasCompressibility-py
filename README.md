# GasCompressibility-py
GasCompressibility-py is a Python library for calculating the gas compressibility factor, $`Z`$, based on real gas law. 

It is designed with practical oil field application in mind, in which the required inputs ($`T`$, $`P`$, and $`\gamma_{g}`$) can be readily obtained from the surface facility.
