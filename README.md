# GasCompressibility-py
GasCompressibility-py is a Python library for calculating the gas compressibility factor, $`Z`$, based on real gas law. It is designed with practical oil field application in mind, in which the required inputs ($`T`$, $`P`$, and $`\gamma_{g}`$) can be readily obtained from the surface facility. 



and it's associated attributes ($`T_{r}, P_{r}, P^{'}_{pc}, P^{'}_{pc}`$.
