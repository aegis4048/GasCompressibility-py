As a petroleum engineer, I understand that many professionals in the oil and gas industry might not be very familiar
with Python. If you're struggling with basic installation issues or are unsure about programming concepts like classes,
attributes, methods, functions, objects, or dictionaries, please don't hesitate to ask your programming questions here.
It's important to remember that there's no such thing as a "stupid" question, as many users of this package may not
have a strong programming background. Just like on StackOverflow, the questions you ask might provide valuable insights
to others facing similar struggles.
